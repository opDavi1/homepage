# Instructions
1. Download this repo using
```console
git clone https://github.com/opDavi1/homepage.git --depth=1
```
2. Simply set your web browser's custom homepage URL to the URL of the file. The URL of the file should start with something like `file:///`.

The background image is randomized every time you load the page. To add a background, add an image to the `bg/` folder and then add the file name to `bg_list` in `bg.js`.
Same thing with the splash text under the title. Just add or remove anything from `quotes` in `splash.js`.
