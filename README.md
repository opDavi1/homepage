Simply set your web browser's custom homepage url to the url of the file. It should start with something like `file:///`.

The background image is randomized every time you load the page. To add a background, add an image to the `bg/` folder and then add the file name to `bg_list` in `bg.js`.
Same thing with the splash text under the title. Just add or remove anything from `quotes` in `splash.js`.
